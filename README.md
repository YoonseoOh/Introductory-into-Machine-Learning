# Introductory-into-Machine-Learning
# call necessary libraries to use in the following code. 
# 'mnist.data.values' contains the pixel values and 'mnist.target.values' contains the labels 
# bring non-overlapping data and check the range of the values
# convert pixel values into binary data for Bernoulli naive bays
# allocate ratio to dive the data 
# obtain prior probabilities 
# calculate the probability of each characteristic for each class
# defining the 'predict' method
# find the class with the highest log posterior probability
# train model and perform predictions on test data
# calculate the accuracy of the model
